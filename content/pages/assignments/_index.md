This critical response paper will be a short assignment of 3–4 pages in which you write a critical review of a film required for the course. This assignment is aimed at giving you the opportunity to practice film criticism and learn how to write about visual content. 

The essay is due during Session 6 and is worth 20% of the final grade.

Final Essay

The final essay will consist of one of two options: either an essay response to a set of prompt questions distributed in the last weeks of class, or an independent research paper exploring a particular cinematic text through the application of course concepts in your analysis. The final will demonstrate your proficiency in applying concepts relevant to queer representation we have been studying over the course of the term.

The essay is due during Session 13 and is worth 30% of the final grade.
